Overview
========

scisbi is a Scientific Machine Learning package for Simulation Based Inference.

What is scisbi?
---------------

scisbi provides tools and algorithms for simulation-based inference, allowing researchers to:

- Perform approximate Bayesian computation (ABC)
- Use advanced inference methods like JANA and Simformer
- Work with various simulators for different scientific domains
- Apply statistical inference techniques to complex models
