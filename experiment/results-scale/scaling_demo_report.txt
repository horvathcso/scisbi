GAUSSIAN SCALING DEMO REPORT
========================================

OVERALL STATISTICS:
- Total runs: 30
- Successful runs: 26
- Success rate: 86.67%

METHOD PERFORMANCE:

ABC-Rejection:
- Average runtime: 0.264s
- Average MSE: 0.5620
- Success rate: 100.00%

ABC-MCMC:
- Average runtime: 0.443s
- Average MSE: 1.9949
- Success rate: 73.33%

KEY FINDINGS:
1. ABC-Rejection shows exponential runtime growth with decreasing tolerance
2. ABC-MCMC has more stable runtime but can fail with tight tolerances
3. Both methods benefit from increased sample sizes for accuracy
4. Trade-off exists between computational cost and accuracy

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- Use tolerance >= 0.5 for interactive work
- ABC-Rejection good for quick results with loose tolerances
- ABC-MCMC better for consistent performance
